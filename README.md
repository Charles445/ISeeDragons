ISeeDragons
===========
#### Ok... Dragons in RLCraft are hard... But do they have to have a personal cloaking device that activates when only 64+ blocks away form the player?!

This mod fixes Ice and Fire dragon render distance.
(patches iceandfire:icedragon and iceandfire:firedragon tracking range server side)

RLCraft still uses an older version of Ice and Fire because the dragons nerfed in newer versions. Dragons are invisible when over 64 blocks away (kind of immersion breaking!). This mod is a work-a-round for that old bug.

This mod can be installed on both client and only needs to be installed on the server when on multiplayer. (for single player, install it on the client)
