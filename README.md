ISeeDragons
===========
#### Ok... Dragons in RLCraft are hard... But do they have to have a personal cloaking device that activates when only 64+ blocks away form the player?!

This mod changes the default entity render distance form 64 blocks to 128 blocks.

RLCraft still uses an older version of Ice and Fire because the dragons nerfed in newer versions. Dragons are invidiable when over 64 blocks away (kind of immersion breaking!). This mod is a work-a-round for that old bug.

note: This mod effects more than just dragons and might cause a tiny bit of lag.
